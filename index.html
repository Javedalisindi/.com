												</div>
												<p class="fn__desc">The US dollar continued its upward march on Monday as it rose above Rs210 against the local currency during early morning trade in the interbank market.
													<br>
													According to the Forex Association of Pakistan (FAP), the rupee depreciated sharply by Rs2.45 to close at an all-time low of Rs210.2 against the dollar from Friday's close of Rs207.75.
													<br>
													In the open market the greenback was trading at Rs214 as of 4:50pm. Meanwhile, domestic gold prices also hit an all-time high of Rs147,250 per tola.</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">Meanwhile, Zafar Paracha, general secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan, said that the market was under severe distress but the authorities seemed to be oblivious to it. "It seems as if another condition put forward by the IMF is the devaluation of rupee because no one seems to care about it and there's silence everywhere."

													He cautioned that if this trend persists, Pakistan could head towards a default like Sri Lanka. "It is extremely crucial for the government to take steps or else the country will default."
													
													Earlier today, in a weekly overview, local financial portal Tresmark said that the rupee's misery was compounded by the ultra low levels of forex reserves.</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">According to SBP, Pakistan's reserves have fallen by another $234 million to close just below $15 billion. The central bank's share in these reserves is just under $9 billion.

													"With almost no free liquidity, it is expected that the central bank does not have the resources to control the market," it pointed out. "With low levels of inflows and substantial outflows, especially end of June, SBP is dipping in to commercial bank's share of reserves to square payments, resulting in low or negative swap premiums."
													
													Keeping this in mind, it went on, there was no stopping the rupee from further losses.
													
													"On average, it (the market) is losing Re1 every day and will only stop when Pakistan receives fresh inflows. If we were to assume that that inflow will be from IMF, then the government should focus all its resources on having IMF on board and jump the queue as we can not afford even another week.</p>

												</div>
												<p class="fn__desc">Cafe Imran is open round the clock and is situated on the left of the main National Highway, in the small sleepy town of Gharo. Why and how it came to be is somewhat of a mystery, but through sheer hard work and some culinary wonders, it has flourished into a bustling, fully air-conditioned restaurant, celebrated for its many signature dishes and a very hands-on courteous staff.

													A jewel in the crown of roadside restaurants on the National Highway, Cafe Imran at Gharo is every bit worth the short trip from Karachi.</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">Mostly frequented by families on weekends on an early morning drive, Cafe Imran caters to all your desi cravings, from chana tarkari [chick pea curry], nihari, mutton kaleji (liver), mutton qeema [fried minced meat], mutton brain masala, namkeen [salted] roast, and with a selection of Pakistani and continental omelettes, and stuffed or plain parathas.
													<br>
													The menu also extends into brunch deals. An assortment of hot beverages, especially doodh patti chai is the perfect accompaniment to wash down these desi treats.

													State companies made a point of publicly signing deals and many firms had stalls with floor-to-ceiling display screens and glamorous attendants at the 25th St Petersburg International Economic Forum, which aims to rival the Davos World Economic Forum.

													But the Western investors and investment bankers who had turned up in previous years were conspicuously absent.</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">“New business from the Italian side is just frozen,” Italian businessman Vincenzo Trani told Reuters on the sidelines of a session titled “Western investors in Russia: new realities”.</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">“New investment is just impossible and people are not increasing investments.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said a denial of service attack, which works by flooding servers with bogus traffic, had struck the forum's accreditation and admission systems. He did not apportion blame but the situation in Ukraine loomed large.

												</div>
												<p class="fn__desc">A judicial magistrate in Karachi directed the relevant authorities on Saturday to conduct a post-mortem examination of deceased lawmaker and television personality Aamir Liaquat Hussain, who passed away on June 9 and was buried the next day.

													In a copy of the order, which is available with Dawn.com, Judicial Magistrate (East) Wazeer Hussain Memon stated, "It is crystal clear that the cause of death of deceased is still uncertain which itself has raised question on the death, either it is natural or unnatural, and could only be ascertained after exhumation of dead body and its examination."
													
													He further wrote, "In the given facts and circumstances of the case at hand and particularly in light of guidelines set by honourable superior courts on the subject, I am of the considered view that disinterment of the body of deceased Dr Aamir Liaquat Hussain is inevitable to determine the actual cause of his death in order to remove suspicions and clouds of doubt over his death."</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">Hussain, 50, had passed away at his house in Karachi's Khudadad Colony earlier this month.

													Police had told Dawn at the time that according to his domestic staff, he was not feeling well, but did not go for a medical checkup. His health later deteriorated after which he was taken to the Aga Khan University Hospital, where he was pronounced as dead.
													
													Police said Hussain's residence had been sealed for further investigation after a crime scene unit examined the house and collected evidence.
													
													Separately Karachi East Zone DIG Muquddus Haider had told Dawn that there appeared to be no injury marks on his body.
													
													Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed had told Dawn Hussain's body was brought to the Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre's emergency ward around 3pm that day, and he was declared dead on arrival. While the body was shifted to the mortuary for completion of medico-legal formalities, the family refused to have an autopsy conducted, she said.
													
													Hussain's former wife, Bushra Iqbal, with whom he had two children, had also confirmed that his "heirs, Ahmad Aamir and Dua Aamir, had refused his post-mortem.
													
													"According to their wishes, the deceased will be taken to his last place of rest with respect," she had said in a post on Instagram.
													
													Iqbal had added that Hussain would be buried at the graveyard at Abdullah Shah Ghazi's shrine.
													
													But his burial had been delayed by hours amid an impasse between police and the deceased's family over the matter of his autopsy.
													
													For their part, police had initiated proceedings under Section 174 (police to inquire to report in suicide, etc) of the Criminal Procedure Code for his post-mortem examination.</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">The matter was settled after it was taken to a judicial magistrate, before Hussain's heirs had appeared and given their statements on the matter.

													Later, police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed along with the judicial magistrate had reached the morgue where Hussain's body was kept and the body was handed over to the heirs after a preliminary examination.
													
													Hussian was subsequently laid to rest on the premises of Abdullah Shah Ghazi's shrine.</p>

													<b>Saudi Arabia on Saturday welcomed its first batch of Haj pilgrims since before the coronavirus pandemic, which prompted authorities to sharply restrict the annual ritual.</b>
													<br>
													The group from Indonesia landed in the city of Madina and was set to travel south to the holy city of Makkah in the coming weeks to prepare for the Haj next month, state media reported.
“Today we received the first group of this year's pilgrims from Indonesia, and the flights will continue from Malaysia and India,” Mohammed al-Bijawi of the country's Haj Ministry told the state-run Al-Ekhbariya channel.

“Today we are happy to receive the guests of God from outside the kingdom, after a two-year interruption due to the pandemic,” he added, describing Saudi Arabia as “fully prepared” to accommodate them.


												</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">Usually one of the world's largest religious gatherings, about 2.5 million people participated in 2019.

													But after the onset of the pandemic in 2020, Saudi authorities announced they would only let 1,000 pilgrims take part.
													
													The following year, they increased the total to 60,000 fully vaccinated Saudi citizens and residents chosen through a lottery.</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">In April, the kingdom announced it would permit one million Muslims from inside and outside the country to participate in this year's Haj, which will take place in July.

													Hosting the Haj is a matter of prestige for Saudi rulers, as the custodianship of Islam's holiest sites is the most powerful source of their political legitimacy.
													
													Before the pandemic, Muslim pilgrimages were major revenue earners for the kingdom, bringing in about $12 billion annually.
													
													This year's pilgrimage will be limited to vaccinated Muslims under age 65, the Haj Ministry has said.
													
													Those coming from outside Saudi Arabia, who must apply for Haj visas, are required to submit a negative Covid-19 PCR result from a test taken within 72 hours of travel.</p>

												<p class="fn__desc"><b>KARACHI: A cabinet minister's plea to the public to help overcome the foreign exchange glut by consuming less tea has caused "a storm in a teacup".</b>
												<br>Pakistan, which has been the world's leading importer of tea for several years, saw tea imports rise to $423.466 million in July-February (2021-22). In the same period of the previous fiscal, the figure was $379.314 million, APP news agency quoted the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) as reporting earlier this year.

												According to AFP, the latest government figures show Pakistan pays over $515 million a year to bring in the commodity, mostly from Kenya. However, the country is suffering a long-brewing economic crisis with dwindling foreign reserves used to pay the crippling debt.</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">“I would also appeal to the nation to cut down one or two cups of tea because the tea we import is also imported on credit,” federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal said on Tuesday.
													But this message did not go down well with most Pakistanis, who drink tea in many forms — black, green, hot, cold, sweet, salted and spiced.

“Why should we reduce the use of tea... we drink at our own expense, we don't drink with government money,” said Jan Mohammad, 45, a truck driver who says he drinks between 15 to 20 cups a day.
												</p>
												<p class="fn__desc">“The government has increased its expenditure. They travel in big cars with protocol but we only enjoy tea,” said Muhammad.

													At a tea stall in Islamabad's Aabpara market, baker Mohammad Ibrahim said he drank 12 cups every day.
													
													“I take three, four cups in the morning, then three in the afternoon and three, four late night,” he said.
													
													“This is my addiction.” At the same restaurant, Tanveer Iqbal agreed that people should cut down -- even as he and his four children sipped piping hot cups of the drink.
													
													The university professor noted tea was routinely served at almost every meeting -- especially those held by government officials.
													
													“How will we reduce the use of tea when tea is the main drink in all the official meetings?” he asked.
